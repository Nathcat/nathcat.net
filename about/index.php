                    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                    <!--<p>
                        This is a question I think we should all ask ourselves sometimes, and one I have asked myself a lot in the past. I don't
                        think we are defined only by our callings in life, but it certainly does play a part.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I started programming when I was eleven years old, it was incorporated as part of my Maths classes at the time, it
                        didn't last long and a lot of the others in my class didn't get along with it, but I was hooked from the first line.
                        Even after we stopped doing it in class I continued learning on my own, I stuck with Python for a while actually,
                        I think the lack of a structured learning routine and being busy with other school work meant I developed my ability
                        quite slowly at the start. But eventually my school decided to offer Computer Science as a GCSE subject, just in time
                        for me to take the subject.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My teacher saw my potential and helped me develop my programming, expanding away from Python into languages such as Java,
                        and even some C/C++ and C#. Not long after this we the Covid pandemic happened, and we began online learning, it was
                        during this period that I really put a lot of work into my programming. The key point was a particular week in December 2020,
                        when I created I think 3 small projects in the space of a week.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Looking back at those projects, they really don't hold up to the standard of programming I hold myself to now, but at the
                        time they were the best I had ever produced. During this time I spent every free minute I had typing away in an IDE,
                        developing my skills with every project I created.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Fast-forward to now, I am studying Computer Science at the University of Sussex, I achieved very high grades in both
                        GCSE and A-Level Computer Science, and I don't plan to stop there.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Personally, programming is not just a means to an end, it's not just a way to create a computational solution to a problem,
                        I honestly feel like it's a part of who I am, it's where I go to escape the hardships of the real world, and it will
                        always be with me, where many people have proven to be... problematic... in my life, programming has always been there
                        as an escape from it all.
                    </p>-->

                    <p>
                        I have been programming for eight years now, since I started learning Python in Maths lessons every two weeks. While the
                        rest of my class hated it, something about it stuck with me, and from the first program I ran, I was hooked.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After those lessons stopped, I continued learning Python on my own, and thats how it stayed for two years. My school at time
                        didn't have any provision for Computer Science or Programming. Eventually however, they started offering Computer Science as a 
                        GCSE subject, and of course I took it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My GCSE Computer Science teacher really helped me grow and develop my skills, he pushed me to improve in every aspect of my education,
                        and those are lessons that I kept with me over the years. Once he discovered my programming, he suggested to me that I learn Java,
                        and even gave me a book that he used to learn Java.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It was around this time that the Covid pandemic hit. Over the lockdowns I was able to develop my programming even more, every free minute
                        I had between live lessons was spent typing away into an IDE, or testing code I had written before that lesson. All this work culminated in my
                        GCSE coursework project, which is actually available as an archive on my GitHub. Of course, this project does not compare to some of the projects
                        I have produced since then.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Over A-Levels I continued this kind of work ethic. Almost every free minute I had was spent programming and developing my skills. I started to
                        compete in competitions and getting good results, I started releasing some of my work publically. To finish off those two years, I created my biggest
                        completed project to date, MessageCat, for my A-Level coursework. There are of course many flaws in it, but I have been working on improving, and
                        I am always learning new things from each project I take on.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For me programming is more than just a means to solve a problem, it is a part of who I am. There is something about it that just, works
                        in my head, it's like I was made for programming, and I plan to use that passion throughout my career.
