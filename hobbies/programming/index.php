                <h1 id="intro">Programming</h1>

                <p>
                    I have been programming since I was 11, my Secondary School did not teach Computer Science as a dedicated subject
                    at the time so we had fortnightly programming lessons in Maths where we would learn basic Python through
                    codecademy. While the rest of my class hated these lessons, I loved them. I found that I just seemed to
                    understand the code, obviously I don't mean a technical understanding, but I mean conceptually I just sort of
                    understood it, and I found great passion in writing it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Eventually my school began to offer Computer Science as an option for GCSEs, just in time for me to make my GCSE choices!
                    Naturally I chose it (along with three other subjects), and continued my studies in the subject. I knew from that first
                    programming lesson in year 7 that this was what I wanted to do with my life, and I was immensely grateful to have been
                    given the opportunity to study it further. This gave me the opportunity to branch out into many different languages, my
                    primary languages at the moment are Java, and C/C++, although I have experience in many others.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After I had finished my GCSEs I continued to study Computer Science at A-Level, and am now studying towards a degree in the
                    subject at the University Of Sussex. I still feel that same passion when writing code as I did when I was 11, it's like it has
                    become a part of who I am.
                </p>

                <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>

                <p>
                    I have completed many projects since I started Programming, learning new skills with each one. Here you will find my greatest ones,
                    which clearly show my progression through my years of Programming.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are many more projects that I have not listed here, you can find all of them on either my <a href="https://github.com/Nathcat">GitHub</a> page, or my <a href="https://repl.it/@Nathcat">repl.it</a> page.
                </p>


                <h3 id="project1">Python Snake, and Tetris</h3>

                <p>
                    These two projects came about during a COVID-19 lockdown in late 2020. Up until this point I didn't really have any major projects,
                    but had been building my programming skills for the better part of 4 years, especially over the lockdowns. In the space of one week,
                    I completed I think three small projects, and was definitely a turning point which led to bigger things in my Programming career.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Two of these projects were the classic games Snake and Tetris, written in Python, below are links to their GitHub pages.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/Nathcat/Python-Tetris">Python Tetris</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/Nathcat/Python-Snake">Python Snake</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Of course, looking back on their source code now I can only see flaws, and places to improve, but at the time I was incredibly
                    proud of both of these projects, because they were the most complex pieces of code I'd written up to that point. Now that I've
                    completed much more complex projects, these seem like such insignificant things, but their role in the development of my
                    Programming is undeniable.
                </p>

                
                <h3 id="project2">Java Chat Room</h3>

                <a href="https://github.com/Nathcat/Java-Chat-Room">Java Chat Room on GitHub</a>
                <p>
                    Again a relatively simple project, which was both my first adventure into Java GUI programming, and the use of TCP/IP sockets.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This laid the groundwork for something I would now consider to be one of my specific strengths, that is programs which make
                    use of networking with TCP/IP sockets in Java. This plays a much larger role in one of my later projects, which I consider to be my most
                    complex to date.
                </p>


                <h3 id="project3">Uno in C++</h3>

                <a href="https://github.com/Nathcat/Uno">Uno in C++ on GitHub</a>
                <p>
                    This was my first real use of C++, and to date probably the project which has had the most attention. I origianlly released it on
                    <a href="https://repl.it/@Nathcat/Uno?v=1">repl.it</a>, and it gained roughly 3000 plays in a week before it quietened down.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All of the projects so far have been relatively simple, but now we start to venture out into much more complex programs.
                </p>


                <h3 id="project4">In The Dark</h3>

                <p>
                    In The Dark was the first Unity game I publicly released on the Google Play store, like the rest of my applications on there, it did not receive
                    a huge amount of attention. Although I feel I should mention that this was not necessarily a comment on the quality of the application,
                    but on my ability to promote my work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was very proud of this game at the time, I have since produced much more impressive works but this will always be the first.
                </p>


                <h3 id="project5">Logger</h3>

                <p>
                    My second game to be released on the Google Play store, and possibly the biggest faliure in popularity ever. I don't remember having a single
                    download from this release. Although it was my first attempt to monetise an application.
                </p>


                <h3 id="project6">Slinger</h3>

                <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Nathcat.Slinger&hl=en&gl=US">Slinger on Google Play</a>

                <p>
                    Slinger is my third game on the Google play store. It is the only one still running and available, although I stopped trying to promote it a long time ago,
                    and is effectively self-maintaining at this point.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am still very proud of this game and the amount of work I put into it, if I had the option to I would love to try and promote it further and
                    reap some reward for my work, but for the moment I don't see any option to.
                </p>


                <h3 id="project7">MessageCat</h3>

                <p>
                    MessageCat is a cloud based internet communication system I created for my A-Level coursework. If you are interested in the documentation I wrote
                    for this project you can download it <a href="../../static/docs/Nathan Baines - MessageCat.pdf">here</a>, all 240 pages of it :).
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is by far the most complex system I have created, and also involved creating <a href="https://github.com/Nathcat/RSACryptoSystem">my own implementation of the RSA asymmetric encryption algorithm</a>.
                    I put a lot of work into this project and I got the result I deserved for it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As mentioned in the documentation, I targeted Android 12, the highest available version, for this project. However, during development, Google released
                    Android 13, which happened to implement changes to background services which meant that the <i>Networker service</i>, effectively the backbone of the entire
                    application, no longer ran while the application was closed, which was essential for things like notifications to appear when messages were received while the application
                    was closed. I also wasn't particularly happy with the way I had implemented the UI.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a result, once I had finished my coursework, accepting the project despite its flaws, I started to redevelop the client application to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use the background services API <i>properly</i></li>
                        <li>Use Jetpack Compose UI framework rather than native views</li>
                    </ul>

                </p>
                <p>
                    The second point requires the use of Kotlin, which is effectively a superset of Java, meaning that the two languages are, to some extent, interchangeable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This re-implementation is not yet complete, as I have not yet had the means to dedicate a sufficient amount of time to it, although I would like to be able to finish it.
