        <h1>Vectors</h1>
        <p>
            Vectors are a way of representing a position in an n-dimensional space, most commonly 2 or 3 dimensions.
        </p>
        <p>
            They consist of multiple components, the number of components is equal to the number of dimensions the vector exists
            in, and each component describes a displacement along an axis for that dimension. Hence by combining these
            displacements, we have a final position.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are generally two ways in which Vectors are represented, as rows, and as columns:
        </p>
        <p>
            $\displaystyle{
                \vec{a}=\left(
                \begin{array}{cccc}
                \\a_1&a_2&\cdots &a_n
                \end{array}
                \right)
            }$ and $\displaystyle{
                \vec{b}=\left(
                \begin{array}{c}
                b_1\\b_2\\\vdots\\b_n
                \end{array}    
                \right)
            }$
        </p>
        <p>
            It is common to think about vectors as a type of matrix, as they are commonly used in operations with matrices,
            but we may interpret them differently to a matrix.
        </p>

        <h2>Vector Transposition</h2>
        <p>
            Vectors may be transposed to transform them between row and column
            representations.
        </p>
        <p>
            $
            \vec{x}=
            \left(\begin{array}{c}
            x_1\\ x_2\\ \vdots\\ x_n
            \end{array}\right) \in \mathbb{R}^n
            \to
            \vec{x}^T=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
            \\x_1&x_2&\cdots &x_n
            \end{array}\right)
            $
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember that multiplying a row vector by a column vector gives
            a real, single dimensional value:
        </p>
        <p>
            $\displaystyle{
            \left(
            \begin{array}{cccc}
            \\p_1&p_2&\cdots &p_n
            \end{array}    
            \right)

            \left(
            \begin{array}{c}
            x_1\\ x_2\\ \vdots\\ x_n
            \end{array}    
            \right)
            =
            \sum_{i=1}^{n}p_ix_i\in\mathbb{R}
            }$
        </p>
        <p>
            So, $\vec{x}^T\vec{x}\in\mathbb{R}$
        </p>

        <h2>Euclidean Norm</h2>
        <p>
            A common application of this is in computing the Euclidean norm, or
            "length" of a vector.
        </p>
        <p>
            The dot / scalar product:
            $\displaystyle{
            \vec{x}\cdot\vec{y}=\vec{x}^T\vec{y}=\sum_{i=1}^nx_iy_i
            }$
        </p>
        <p>
            And hence the euclidean norm:
            $\displaystyle{
            {\|\vec{x}\|} 
            =\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2}=\sqrt{\vec{x}\cdot\vec{x}}
            }$
        </p>

        <h2>Orthogonality</h2>
        <p>
            Two vectors are Orthogonal if they are perpendicular to each other,
            that is, their dot product is equal to 0:
        </p>
        <p>
            $\displaystyle{
                \vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}=
                \sum_{i=1}^{n}a_ib_i=0
            }$
        </p>
