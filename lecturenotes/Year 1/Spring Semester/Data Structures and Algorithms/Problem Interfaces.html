        <h1>Problem Interfaces</h1>

        <p>
            A Problem interfaces specifies the problem we want to solve, a data structure
            represents a solution to the problem, or an implementation of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Interface</h3>

            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Static sequence interface</h2>
        <p>
            This problem is concerned with storing data in a static sequence, static meaning it
            cannot change. The items themselves may be changed but the properties of the sequence
            itself (length, data type, etc...) cannot be changed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Operations:
            <ul>
                <li><md-span>`BUILD(X)`</md-span> - Build a static sequence from collection $X$.</li>
                <li><md-span>`ITER_SEQ()`</md-span> - Get each item in the sequence.</li>
                <li><md-span>`GET_AT(i)`</md-span> - Get $x_i$.</li>
                <li><md-span>`SET_AT(i, x)`</md-span> - Set $x_i\leftarrow x$.</li>
                <li><md-span>`LEN()`</md-span> - Return the number of items $n$ in the sequence.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            This interface is solved using a simple, static array.
        </p>

        <h2>Dynamic sequence interface</h2>
        <p>
            This problem is concerned with storing data in a way such the the properties of
            the sequence itself may change. Items may be added / removed, and the sequence
            is dynamically resized accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
            This includes the same operations as a static sequence, with two additions:
            <ul>
                <li><md-span>`INSERT_AT(i, x)`</md-span> - Insert $x$ at $i$ such that $x_i\leftarrow x$, and all original $x_i\rightarrow x_{i+1}$, the same for all the following elements of the sequence.</li>
                <li><md-span>`REMOVE_AT(i)`</md-span> - Remove $x_i$.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            These are the most common implementations of this:
            <ul>
                <li>Static arrays</li>
                <li>Linked lists</li>
                <li>Dynamic arrays</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that static arrays are listed. You may implement a dynamic sequence using
            a static array, but this is not particularly efficient according to our model
            of computation, when compared with something like a linked list implementation,
            but then referencing an element at a particular index would be faster in a static
            array implementation than a linked list.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main downside of a linked list is that you cannot go straight to the middle / end
            without iterating through it to the desired point. There is the idea of a doubly linked list,
            which stores a pointer to the previous element in the list with each element, and a 
            pointer to the tail of the list rather than just the head. This improves this issue,
            but does not completely solve it and the time to reference any particular item not
            at the front or end of the list still grows with a linear complexity (although in
            practice it would more than likely be faster).
