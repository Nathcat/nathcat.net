                        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                        <p>
                            This is a question I think we should all ask ourselves sometimes, and one I have asked myself a lot in the past. I don't
                            think we are defined only by our callings in life, but it certainly does play a part.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I started programming when I was eleven years old, it was incorporated as part of my Maths classes at the time, it
                            didn't last long and a lot of the others in my class didn't get along with it, but I was hooked from the first line.
                            Even after we stopped doing it in class I continued learning on my own, I stuck with Python for a while actually,
                            I think the lack of a structured learning routine and being busy with other school work meant I developed my ability
                            quite slowly at the start. But eventually my school decided to offer Computer Science as a GCSE subject, just in time
                            for me to take the subject.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My teacher saw my potential and helped me develop my programming, expanding away from Python into languages such as Java,
                            and even some C/C++ and C#. Not long after this we the Covid pandemic happened, and we began online learning, it was
                            during this period that I really put a lot of work into my programming. The key point was a particular week in December 2020,
                            when I created I think 3 small projects in the space of a week.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Looking back at those projects, they really don't hold up to the standard of programming I hold myself to now, but at the
                            time they were the best I had ever produced. During this time I spent every free minute I had typing away in an IDE,
                            developing my skills with every project I created.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Fast-forward to now, I am studying Computer Science at the University of Sussex, I achieved very high grades in both
                            GCSE and A-Level Computer Science, and I don't plan to stop there.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Personally, programming is not just a means to an end, it's not just a way to create a computational solution to a problem,
                            I honestly feel like it's a part of who I am, it's where I go to escape the hardships of the real world, and it will
                            always be with me, where many people have proven to be... problematic... in my life, programming has always been there
                            as an escape from it all.
