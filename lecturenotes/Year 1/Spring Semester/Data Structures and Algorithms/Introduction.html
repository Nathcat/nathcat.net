        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <h2>What is an Algorithm?</h2>
        <p>
            An algorithm is a well-defined computation procedure which takes some input and
            produces an output in a finite time. An algorithm may be called correct if it both
            produces the desired output, and halts.
        </p>
        <p>
            An algorithm can be proved to be correct using the principle of induction:
        </p>
        <p>
            $\displaystyle{\begin{array}{l}
                P(0) \mathrm{ is true} \\
                \mathrm{For some } k\geq 0, P(k)\Rightarrow P(k+1)
            \end{array}}$
        </p>

        <h2>Asymptotic Complexity</h2>
        <p>
            There are three notations for Asymptotic Complexity of Algorithms:
        </p>
        <p>
            $\displaystyle{\begin{array}{l}
                O(g(n))\geq\Theta (g(n))\geq\Omega (g(n))
            \end{array}}$
        </p>
        <p>
            $O$ and $\Omega$ notations are upper and lower bounds for the growth of a function
            respectively, and $\Theta$ is a tight bound lying between the two.
        </p>

        <h2>Computational Model</h2>
        <p>
            We will model a computer as an infinite array of machine words.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><i>Word - A sequence of bits.</i></b>
        </p>
        <p>
            This infinite array of machine words is called memory. We also have a process which
            is able to operate on this memory.
        </p>
        <p>
            We assume that:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic binary operations on two words are performed in $\Theta (1)$.</li>
                <li>
                    Given a word $a$, the processor may read / write the word whose address
                    is $a$ in $\Theta (1)$.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The processor may allocated and initialise $n$ consecutive words in $\Theta (n)$.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Given these assumptions, if we are to operate on an input of $n$ words, then the size
            of the machine words $w$ must satisfy $2^w\geq n$, and $w\geq log_2(n)$, to ensure
            that the processor is able to address the entire input. Otherwise the size of a word
            would be insufficient to offer enough combinations to address all of the words in
            the input.
