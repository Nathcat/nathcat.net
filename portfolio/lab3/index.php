                        <h2>Intro to Multimedia Lab class 3</h2>

                        <p>
                            This class was an introduction to Bootstrap CSS, and by extension JQuery, since Bootstrap requires JQuery. Although we did not actually write any Javascript using
                            JQuery ourselves, that is the next lab I believe.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It occurs to me after having completed this lab that the nav element exists, and that there are a number of Bootstrap classes which allow you to create
                            better looking and functioning navigation bars than the one I have implemented in this website at the time of writing. The question now is do I change what
                            I have already implemented to use these new features.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I would argue I should, since it will give me practice in using said new features. So that is what I am going to do, however much more it annoys myself.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It is in some ways a shame, since I put a fair amount of work into my current implementation, but it's okay, my own fault really for not looking into
                            existing solutions to the problem I was trying to solve.
                        </p>
